# Comparison project between the climate indices libraries

It purpose is to validate that the results of Climdex (Climpact) and Icclim (Xclim) are similar.

Two scripts are provided:
- A script for direct necdf comparison (work in progress)
- A script to compute à la volé icclim indices and compare to climpact netcdf result. (work in progress)
    Ideally, this script should call climpact but calling R code from python is currently not working.
