# Comparison project between the climate indices computation libraries

It purpose is to validate that the results of Climdex/Climpact, Icclim and Xclim.

A few scripts are provided:
- A script for direct necdf comparison (work in progress)
- A script to compute à la volé icclim indices and compare to climpact netcdf result. (work in progress)
    Ideally, this script should call climpact but calling R code from python is currently not working.
